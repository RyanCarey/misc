A "catastrophe" is a down (kata-) turn (strephein) [1], so its opposite could be an "anastrophe" (an upturn).

The word "anastrophe" does already have a meaning in linguistics, but plenty of useful words have two meanings that can be distinguished based on context, so I expect this would be the case here.
